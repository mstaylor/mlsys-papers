title = "MPI for Python",
abstract = "MPI for Python provides bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language and allows any Python program to exploit multiple processors. This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1 specification and defines an object-oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++ bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of general Python objects. Efficiency has been tested in a Beowulf class cluster and satisfying results were obtained. MPI for Python is open source and available for download on the web (http://www.cimec.org.ar/python).",
